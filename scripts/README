COMP 412, Fall 2015

This directory contains a set of tools to assist in Lab 2.

AllocAndRunAll -- takes each ILOC file in a directory, runs it
       through a register allocator; runs the output of that
       allocator through the simulator; and compares the results
       of the simulated execution against the original file's 
       OUTPUT spec.

       Syntax:
		AllocAndRunAll k

       where "k" is the number of registers that the allocator
       should target.

       Shell variables defined in "AllocAndRunAll" specify locations
       for the various tools and some of the paramters that they 
       use.

       TO USE THIS SCRIPT: copy all of the scripts into your directory.
       Update the various pathnames in ALL of the scripts so that they 
       point to your copies of the script and, especially, to your 
       allocator rather than to lab2_ref. Execute it as ./RunAll

       	    	./AllocAndRunAll k

       where k is a small integer specifying the number of registers
       for the allocator to use.

       NOTE: These scripts use a log file in your home directory. (See 
       the variable "LOG".) They perform no clever synchronization, so
       only run one copy of the script at a time. They do not erase the
       log file.

RunAll -- Executes the ILOC files in a directory. The primary point of 
       this script is to validate behavior of an ILOC file, using the
       simulator. It validates the input and output specifications at
       the top of the block.

       The script processes each ILOC file in a directory. It runs the 
       file through the ILOC simulator using the command-line flags 
       specified in the "SIM INPUT" comment. It compares the results of
       that simulated execution against the results specified in
       the "OUTPUT" comment.  It reports both whether the OUTPUT
       specs match the code's behavior and the number of cycles 
       that the simulator required to execute the code.

       Syntax:
		RunAll

       Shell variables defined in "RunAll" specify locations for
       the various tools and some of the parameters that they use.

       TO USE THIS SCRIPT: copy all of the scripts into your directory.
       Update all the pathnames. Execute it as ./RunAll

       NOTE: This script will be used to test the correctness of
       the "test block" that you submit with your lab 2 report.
       You should use the script to check the block before you 
       submit it.

       NOTE: These scripts use a log file in your home directory. (See 
       the variable "LOG".) They perform no clever synchronization, so
       only run one copy of the script at a time. They do not erase the
       log file.
